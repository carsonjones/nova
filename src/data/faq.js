    question: `Where is editor/plugin {x}?`,
    answer: `If you don't see it in the list, it doesn't exist yet! The Nova admins only maintain the Vim, Atom, HyperTerm, and iTerm plugins, but the community has built or is building others. Feel free to build one too using the "CONTRIBUTING" guidelines.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Is there an {x} version?`,

  },
  {
    question: `Can you change {x}?`,
    answer: `If it is a bug or syntax not following the Nova color meanings, yes! Please submit an issue on the related GitHub repo. If it is personal preference, sorry we can't accomodate everyone. Feel free to fork, override, or use another theme.`,
  },
  {
    question: `Can I contribute?`,
